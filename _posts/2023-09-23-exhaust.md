The exhaust manifold has some pretty tight curves so there's not enough room for me to use the manifold bolts that came with the engine. Instead I get some manifold studs and cut each one down to exactly the right length for its location. The final fit takes a fair bit of figuring out and requires a different sequence of fitting studs, manifold and nuts for different locations. Before fitting I add a layer of thermal protection to the footwell.

With the manifolds attached it's time to turn my attention to the rest of the exhaust system. One or two joints were a very tight fit with a lot of overlap, so I trimmed it back a bit before deploying the rubber hammer.

At last, everything is in place and roughly symmetrical (to the eye).
