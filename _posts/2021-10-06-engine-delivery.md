Jim Robinson and his son Thomas, trading as [JRV8](https://www.jrv8.co.uk/) up in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, have been absolutely great to deal with. After one or two very helpful chats with Jim where he patiently dealt with all my ignorant questions, I put in an order for one of his extensively rebuilt engine and gearbox packages a few months ago, and today was the big day of the delivery. They'd already sent photos of the engine being packed up so I knew exactly what to expect, but even so it was real treat to see it in the flesh. The kit is still not quite here though, so after a quick once over it was time to put the lid back on, ready to move it somewhere out of the way for a few weeks/months.
