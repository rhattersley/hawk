I'd been putting it off, but at some point I needed to take the plunge and make the holes for the side vents. Starting to cut a hole in a material you've never worked with, from a piece that costs thousands of pounds, and comes with a two year waiting list is a special moment, and the goggles, dust mask and gloves added to the drama! I needn't have worried though: the fiberglass was very predictable to work with. Phew!
