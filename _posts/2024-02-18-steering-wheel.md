The metal spokes on the steering wheel don't quite have the 2.5 mm radius needed for interior fittings in the "specified zone". To remedy this I decided to wrap the spokes with spare vinyl from the dashboard.

The first step was to cut out a piece of vinyl roughly the right shape to cover a single spoke. Then I stuck the vinyl on to the front face of the spoke to keep it in place while I trimmed the vinyl to exactly the right shape.

The next task was to stitch the vinyl together on the reverse face. First I did a line of running stitches down each edge, then I zig-zagged another thread under those running stitches to gradually draw the edges together. The end result is reasonably neat and seems very secure.

From the front it's very tidy and the radius now seems OK. I guess I'll find out soon!
