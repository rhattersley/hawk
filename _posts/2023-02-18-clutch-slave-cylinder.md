A trial fit of the clutch slave cylinder highlighted a small gap with the backplate. I'd rather not fill up the bellhousing with more road grime than necessary so some sort of solution will be required.

A few ideas came to mind: make up a washer to expand the footprint of the cylinder; splodge sealant over the gap; modify the backplate. It didn't take long to settle on doing the job properly and modifying the backplate.

The first step was to transfer the various outlines and bolt positions to paper. (Finally, a use for the brass-rubbing skills they taught us in primary school!) From there it was on to thin card with plenty of trial fittings and fettling, before eventually cutting out a suitable piece of steel.

Out with the old...

... and quite a few days later, after welding, grinding, and all the coats of primer & chassis paint ... in with the new.
