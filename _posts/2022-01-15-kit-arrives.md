It's been a busy couple of months, but mostly only indirectly related to the kit build at best, hence the lack of updates. For example, making good progress on the interior insulation and cladding of the garage, and tracking down a couple of leaks (the joys of a partially subterranean building!).

The one significant preparation milestone was the removal of the shell (minus all identifying marks - those are safely tucked away!) and all the other unwanted bits and bobs (wheels, engine and ancillaries, seats, etc.). The salvagable bits of the shell are going to help other MGBs live on, e.g. the front bulkhead is in a good state so it's going to be cut out and will replace a friend-of-a-friend's.

The rear axle is off to Heathrow Transmissions for a COU refurb (e.g. properly cleaned and painted, new bearings), so it was stripped, the worst of the mud removed, and the oil drained for the trip.

And finally, the big day arrives and after a thirteen hour round trip (including dropping off the axle) the kit is mine. A couple of days later and we move it from a nearby friend's house into the garage.

Right then... the clock starts now...
