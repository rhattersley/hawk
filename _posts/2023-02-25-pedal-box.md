In the interests of avoiding the hot bits of the engine, I decided to take what I think is an unconventional route from the filter to the carb. It runs backwards from the filter, over the passenger footwell, and then across the bulkhead.

Fitting the pedal box was slightly more fiddly than I'd anticipated. Partly this was because the angle between the base and the upright doesn't quite match up with the shape of the footwell. Despite having used a cardboard template to get the location of the holes for the master cylinders, this led to a very slightly bigger hole than I wanted. Time to learn some basic fiberglassing skills!

An initial attempt at laying a small piece of matting around the cut edge failed completely. It was much too tight a radius. After some consultation with the Blue Gee "bible" I switched to building it up with a couple of rounds of short chopped strands.

When finally fitting the pedal box, I compensated for the mismatched angles by making some fiberglass washers from the cutouts for the side vents. This enables a nice tight fit to the end of the footwell, so a thin bead a sealant is all that's needed to make everything watertight.

I also filled the bolt holes with sealant to prevent any water getting in to the footwell from below.
