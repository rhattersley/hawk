## Front suspension (part 1 of ... many?)

At some point I need to get the springs out of the front suspension, so based on [the wisdom of the internet](https://www.mgexp.com/article/front-crossmember-and-suspension-removal.246) I start poking around with various jacks under the spring pan. It all looks very suspect from a safety point of view, so I decide to call in the big guns - friends with extensive car maintenance experience and, equally importantly, a large, hydraulic jack.

Some of the bolts prove somewhat reluctant, but after some persausion from an impact driver and an angle grinder they are all free and the springs are all gently released.
