Most of Gerry's fuel line kit made perfect sense but I couldn't make head or tail of the section from the fuel pump back to the through-floor connection near the tank. Whatever route I tried it ended up about a foot too long! I checked with a neighbouring Hawk owner and they were using a similar route to my attempts, so I gave up and asked [HEL Performance](https://www.helperformance.com/) to make up a new section. They were incredibly helpful and eventually we found a combination of fixings that would work.

A 45 degree bend at the fuel pump:

16 mm P-clips to keep everything away from the bouncy bits:
