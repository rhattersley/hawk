Barely any time free for Garage Things today, but still enough to pop in with the #4 PoziDriv bit I've borrowed and undo the handbrake mounting plate. Perhaps it was the two days soaking in PlusGas, perhaps the area was more protected from moisture... either way, all three bolts came out without much, if any, of a fight.

It doesn't look like much, but every little counts.
