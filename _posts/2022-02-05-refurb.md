The tone of the last couple of weeks has been lots of little jobs - an hour or two in the evenings, or a few stolen hours at the weekend inbetween trips out with the family, or regular chores.

First up is an inventory of all the lovely bits I've acquired with the kit, and figuring out the detailed locations all the different nuts, bolts and washers in Gerry's front suspension setup.

There are eight different kinds of washers/shims, with three of four different internal diameters and a variety of external diameters. Stuart kindly sent some photos which helped narrow things down.

A couple of friends helped lift the bodywork off the chassis, as recommended to make the first few phases of the build easier.

Gerry's front suspension kit still relies on MGB wishbone pivots, but the originals from my MGB are too far gone to refurbish so I've had to resort to brand new ones. Time to get busy with the primer and chassis paint.

Because I've been busy finishing off the garage itself, I haven't had time to refurbish the MGB parts, but finally I get to spend a bit (i.e. hours and hours and hours!) of quality time with the wirebrushes before heading back to the paint.
