The loom comes ready for the side indicators required by the IVA... and modern driving conditions! Happily it's easy to find ones that suit the look of the car.

Next up was the boot handle and catch mechanism. A bit of care is needed to get everything lined up well. Fortunately I still haven't fitted the wheel well so it was easy to climb into the boot and see what everything looked like from the inside!

Trying to fabricate some sort of Cobra replica radiator grille that can meet modern safety standards seems like it will just result in a poor compromise. I'd prefer to go for the stripped back look so I cut and shape a couple of lengths of steel rod to fit the opening, then drill and tap them to accept screws from inside the nose.

Once covered in a couple of coats of chassis black I think the end result looks very tidy.

While the chassis paint was having an outing, I converted an old curtain rail bracket into one for the rear fog light.
