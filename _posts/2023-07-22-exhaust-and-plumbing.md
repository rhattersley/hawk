The exhaust headers sit very close to the footwells, particularly on the driver's side where the extra bulge leaves only a few millimeters of clearance. To help prevent damage to the fibreglass and excessively hot feet, I've wrapped the headers with insulation.

Not bad for my first attempt.

I've gone for classic-look silicone hoses for the coolant circuit. It's dead simple to work with and gives a tidy, understated finish. It's another one of those satisfying jobs where a lot seems to get done quickly.

This photo also shows where I've run the engine bay loom under the lip for the bonnet cutout. On the advice of a friend with previous experience of Lucas coils, I fitted the coil "upside down" to reduce the risk of water ingress.
