Now that I've nearly finished building my new garage, I can finally get this project properly underway and start work on dismantling my MGB donor. It's only a few days/weeks until the chassis & bodywork will be ready for collection, but better late than never!

This is the first time I've undertaken a significant car project, so I'm sure my experience will be riddled with silly mistakes, back-tracking, and painful lessons ... but equally, it's overcoming those kinds of difficulties that makes for a rewarding experience. So here we go!

## Front suspension

Of the main MGB components that I need for the Hawk, I decide to start with the front axle. Given the "well aged" nature of the MGB, I'm pleasantly surprised how easy the spinners are to remove. (I guess that's the flip side of having to check they're tight on a very regular basis.) Wheels off and my first real look at the mechanicals - clearly mucky & rusty, but spinning very nicely so perhaps there's hope.

I'm not 100% whether the anti-roll bar from the MGB can be used with the Hawk front suspension, but I fancy starting with something simple so I remove it anyway.

Miraculously it comes off pretty easily. I take that as a sign that I should quit while I'm ahead and pop back inside for a cup of tea.
