It's been a slow couple of months. The lack of progress has been a little frustrating at times, but progress is still progress and even small steps get the build closer to being road legal.

One job that I could get on with was fitting the radiator. To keep things simple I'd bought an MGB V8 radiator and the corresponding mounts from Gerry, but as usual there was still a fair amount of head scratching at the start. To help make sense of everything and to figure out how to get the thing into the nose of the car, I made a mock up of the radiator and mounts from some plywood and cardboard. I'm pretty sure it's the first time I've ever used bolts with cardboard.

Especially when working on my own, being able to mess around with a lightweight piece of wood instead of a heavy and delicate radiator was a real boon.

The next job was to assemble the twin electric fans, fit them to the radiator and mounts, and then drop the whole thing into the nose. I enlisted the help of two friends to help guide the whole assembly into the nose safely. It's quite a tight fit so the angles have to be just right to avoid it jamming on the way in or out.

So there we have it. All ready to suck in lots of cool air.
