On first inspection the loom is an intimidating beast. How can a car with so few electrical systems need so many wires?! But as with all these jobs, the key to progress is to stop worrying and just take the first step. In this case I decide the first step is simply to go through the comprehensive loom description and label every plug, socket, etc. Very soon it all starts to make sense and the labels will make life a lot easier later on.

I decide to start the electrification process by fitting the lights that the rear loom will connect to. Time for another cardboard template. Care was needed to ensure that the lens cover ended up horizontal as it fits at a very slight angle to the backing plate.

The body doesn't seem to be perfectly symmetrical so the final positioning was done by eye. It's hard to be definite with the measurements though as there a very few well defined reference points.

After a pleasant May morning, the basics are all ready for connecting up.
