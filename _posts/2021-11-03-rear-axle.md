A bit of a mix for this job. As hoped, the prop shaft bolts weren't too much trouble thanks to their proximity to "oily bits", and the handbrake cable and hydraulic line didn't put up a fight. The shock absorber links came undone fine but needed a bit of a persuasion to come loose. The spring shackles required a more robust approach. Finally, the whole assembly was hovering just above a pair of axle stands, held up by just the rubber straps, so after a couple of quick flicks of a pen-knife it's free.
