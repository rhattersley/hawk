The extensively refurbished engine and gearbox from [JRV8](http://www.jrv8.co.uk/) had been sitting in their crate in the corner of the garage for the last few months, but it was now nearly time to fit them to the chassis.

First step, remove the clutch cover plate and mate the gearbox to the engine using a friend's engine crane. Note the use of old curtain poles to move the engine to a more convenient location!

Then it was just a case of popping the rear wheels on and dropping the chassis off the axle stands. A rolling chassis and another major milestone!
