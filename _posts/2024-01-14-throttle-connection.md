In the interests of simplicity and expediency, I've decided to go with a simple throttle cable to provide the link between the pedal and the carb. I can play around with rods and rose joints some time in the future when I feel the need to tinker with something again.

There were two main problems to solve at each end of the cable: how to terminate the cable, and how to attach a return spring.

As shown below, the Hawk supplied replica cast pedal seems to include a small hole that would allow the direct attachment of a return spring. However, because the pedal hangs down from the pivot, the hole and therefore any spring would need to be inside the footwell and towards the driver. At best that seems prone to damage from clumsy boots, and at worst presents a hazard in the case of an accident, so I decided to rule that out.

The arm that attaches to the pedal pivot rotates from front to back as the throttle pedal is depressed, so both the cable and the return spring can be attached from the front of the car.

The old cast aluminium TV stand came in handy again here. After cutting out and sanding down a suitable chunk, I drilled a couple of holes to enable it to be bolted to the front face of the footwell, and a slot for terminating the cable. After this photo was taken I also drilled another small hole to provide the attachment point for the return spring.

The situation at the carb end of things was slightly simpler due to the inclusion of a suitable cable bracket that came with the cable. The only complication was that the attachment point for the return spring was too high and caused the spring to foul the carb mechanism. The solution was a simple plate cut from a piece of scrap metal that provides a lower attachment point.
