The first step in removing wire wheel hubs is to remove the grease cap so you can get at the castle nut underneath. Moss make a handy tool just for the job. Given there's a reasonable chance of needing to go through this process a few times I decide to splash out... only to discover that Moss Europe don't carry that part. Plan B - buy some [5/16" UNF nuts & bolts](https://www.namrick.co.uk/acatalog/Home_U_N_F_Bolts___Nuts__15.html) and make one myself. It's always good to have an excuse for a spot of welding.

The parts arrived today so straight after work it was down to the garage to weld the relevant bits together. The result isn't pretty, but it fits perfectly and after some hard levering it does the job. All the internals were protected from the elements by globs of grease so the split pin & castle nut are a piece of cake and the hubs come off without any trouble.

Voila! My first sight of the all important stub axle.

It only take a few minutes to repeat everything on the other side.

The second stub axle in all its greasy glory.
