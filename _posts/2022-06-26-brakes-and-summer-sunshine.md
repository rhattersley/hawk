Given that brakes are particularly important for keeping life and limb intact, most of the components were bought new rather than rely on refurbishing parts from the MGB. That also had the benefit that progress was rapid.

I haven't run brake lines before so I started with a fair amount of research on the internet to determine the correct styles of flaring to use. That was probably the hardest part of the whole job due to the overlapping, yet different terminology used on each side of the Atlantic! After a couple of practice flares it was on to real thing and the crazy, rollercoaster ride on the rear axle!

For the long front-to-back run I made a mock-up from some thick wire I had banging around. Forming the second flare was a tense moment owing to the risk of ruining such a long piece but thanks to the practice everything went fine.

It's also important for me to take time out sometimes and remind myself why I'm doing all this, so I met up with a friend at a local classic car show for a motivation top-up ...

... and to start getting ideas about paint colours.
