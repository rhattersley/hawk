Another slow few weeks on the car, but that's mostly because we've been off doing fun things over the Christmas period. But there's still time to squeeze in the addition of the twin horns...

... fit the pressure regulator in the usual spot ...

... and then plumb in the fuel supply. The supply to the carb will have to wait for another time.

All nice, simple jobs that can be squeezed into a stolen half hour or so, with a high ratio of progress to head scratching.
