I bought a pair of Mini One seats as a cheap way to get get going with road legal seating. (I've seen some nice Cobra seats with headrests in the 289 register magazine, but I believe they cost about three thousand pounds for a pair so that'll have to wait for another day!)

As is so often the case, the first step involved a sheet of cardboard. This allowed me to map out the locations of the various chassis members and how they relate to the seats and their fixing locations.

Unfortunately, the mounting points for the Mini seats coincide with sections of the chassis. To workaround this problem I bought some thick metal plates and made two pairs of "skis". The seats bolt to the skis, and then the skis are bolted to the floor at locations that are clear of the chassis members.

With hindsight, fitting the seats would have been somewhat easier if it had been done prior to fitting the exhausts. As it was, I needed to use a variety of extensions and a universal joint to tighten all the bolts but after much fiddling, and probably a little mild cursing, both seats were safely in place.
