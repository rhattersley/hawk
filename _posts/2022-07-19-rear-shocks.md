I had decided to go with Gerry's telescopic shocks for the rear end. The original lever arm shock absorbers would have needed costly refurbishment or replacement, so given the suggestions that it improves handling it seemed sensible to switch instead.

The mounts needed a couple of packing washers, both at the top to help with alignment ...

... and at the bottom to avoid the shock body rubbing on the mounting bracket. (It was pointed out to me afterwards that the brackets are definitely not precision parts, so some fettling is commonly required.)

The extra washers at the bottom required lower profile lock nuts, which Gerry was happy to help out with.
