Just a couple of simple bolt-it-on jobs for March. Fitting the handbrake lever (the first bit of "bling" to make it on to the car?) and the frame for the seatbelts.

I'm going to need to come back to the handbrake cable once the exhausts are fitted to work out how to stop it drooping down too far. (This photo also shows my first attempt at preparing the breather tube for the fuel tank. It still needs a suitable breather valve to prevent too much fuel vapour getting out into the garage, and rollover protection.)

The frame for the seatbelt took quite a few rounds of trial fitting and fettling, but was essentially quite straightforward and a good match for the description in the build manual. The hardest part was probably feeding the mounting bolts in from underneath.
