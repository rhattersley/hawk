With all the nuts and bolts that little bit more protected from the elements, removing the lower steering assembly was pretty simple. One of those seemingly rare cases where you really can just follow the instructions in the Haynes manual. No need for the blow-torch or PlusGas at all!

Clearly the gaiters are well past their prime, but the mechnical aspects seem completely sound. Back when the car still had wheels, the steering had a nice smooth feel when pushing the car around the garage. Hopefully just a quick overhaul and it'll be good as new.
